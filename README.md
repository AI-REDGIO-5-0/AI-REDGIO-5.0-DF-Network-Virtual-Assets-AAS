# AI-REDGIO-5.0-DF-Network-Virtual-Assets-AAS
This repository is the dedicated to establish the catalog of virtual assets provided by members of didactic factories network within AI-REDGIO 5.0 project leveraging on Asset Administration Shell framework.  

__Asset Administration Shell Develpoment Tool__

There are several tools to develop AAS packages, the [Eclipse AASX Package Explorerâ„¢](https://github.com/eclipse-aaspe/package-explorer) seems to be more user-freindly providing a graphical user interface for developing version 3 AAS packages (AAS V3) while for developing or viewing version 2 of AAS packages (AAS V2), [AASX Package Explorer](https://github.com/eclipse-aaspe/package-explorer/tree/V2) can be used. The templates of several useful submodels for development of AAS packges can be found [here](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/submodel-templates/tree/main).
There are some essential submodels for developing AAS packages for assets which can be seen [here](https://github.com/AI-REDGIO-5-0/AI-REDGIO-5.0-DF-Network-Virtual-Assets-AAS/tree/main/Essential%20Submodels).
A sample of developing AAS package of an physical asset (here a universal robot) has been provided [here](https://github.com/AI-REDGIO-5-0/AI-REDGIO-5.0-DF-Network-Virtual-Assets-AAS/tree/main/AAS%20package%20sample).
